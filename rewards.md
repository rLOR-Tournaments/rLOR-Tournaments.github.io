## Season Points

Each player gains **1 SP** for each round of Swiss played without surrendering, up to **20 SP** for the season (the equivalent of playing 5/7 full season tourneys).

Each player gains SP from their Match Score at the end of each season tourney's Swiss stage:

| Match Score | SP |
|-------|--------|
| **0** |  **0** |
|   0.5 |    1   |
| **1** |  **2** |
|   1.5 |    4   |
| **2** |  **6** |
|   2.5 |    9   |
| **3** | **12** |
|   3.5 |   16   |
| **4** | **20** |

The winner of each EU & AM season tourney gains an additional **10 SP**.

## SP Tiebreakers

Any ties in SP total are broken in the following order:
1. Match winrate (`MatchesWon / MatchesPlayed`), not including byes or match draws at all.
2. Game winrate (`GamesWon / GamesPlayed`), not including tie games at all.
