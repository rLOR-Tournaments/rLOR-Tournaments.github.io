# Tournament Rounds

## Check-in

The TO will announce the **Round Start** of each new round. After this announcement, each player must check-in by posting (anything) to the `#check-in` channel as soon as possible.

- There are no penalties for checking-in in the **10 minutes** after Round Start.
- At each **10-minute interval** after Round Start, if Player A in a match has checked in but Player B hasn't, then Player B forfeits a game.
- When Player B forfeits a game in this manner, Player A's win total increments by 1. However, the game counter does *not* increment by 1.

  *Example*: Player A checks-in after 2 minutes and Player B checks-in after 14 minutes. A & B's first game is Game 1, and Player A's game record starts at 1-0.
- At each **20-minute interval** after Round Start, if neither Player A nor Player B in a match have checked-in, then the tournament reduces by 1 the number of wins needed by either player to win the match.
- If this reduces the number of such wins to 0, then the match ends in a 0-0 draw.

## Games & Matches

All season tourney formats use Best-of-3 (Bo3) matches with the following rules. Casual tourney formats will generally follow these rules, but may differ on a tourney-by-tourney basis and may use non-Bo3 formats.

- A match ends at the point reached first:
  - The match reaches 3 games played (Game 1, Game 2, and Game 3).
  - A player reaches 2 games won (by `VICTORY`, by forfeit, or by surrender).
  - The TO ends the match (by itself or as part of the round).
- A `TIE GAME` (e.g. at Start of Round, both players are at 1 life and draw a Poison Puffcap) counts as a game played and increments the game counter, but doesn't count as a [whole or partial] win or loss for either player.

  *Example*: Player A is 1-0 and Player B is 0-1 going into Game 2, which then ends as a `TIE GAME`. A remains 1-0, B remains 0-1, and their next game is Game 3. If A wins Game 3, A wins the match 2-0. If A & B tie Game 3, A wins the match 1-0. If B wins Game 3, A & B draw the match 1-1.
- If a player enters a game with an illegal deck, they lose that game. This deck can be either a deck not in their registered lineup or a deck in their lineup that the match format prevents them from using that particular game.
- If a player disconnects while in-game and can't reconnect, they lose that game. Disconnects within the lobby are not normally a loss for either player. If one player was intentionally disconnecting, they instead forfeit that game.
- If the TO ends an ongoing match, it normally ends in either a 1-1 draw if both players won a game or a 0-0 draw elsewise. If one player was intentionally playing slowly, they instead forfeit all remaining games in the match.

If any matches are ongoing **60 minutes** after Round Start, the TO *may* end the round at any time by their discretion. At **Round End**, players must stop all ongoing games. This is not a hard limit. *Player communication is important!* Players in ongoing games should contact the TO with an update before 60 minutes have passed, or run the risk of sudden Round End after 60 minutes.

## Match Reports

At the end of each match, both players must report the result of the match to `#match-results`. A match result is generally accepted in any of these forms:
- Either player posts a *screenshot* of the lobby that shows the final score.
- Both players report the same result.
- The losing player reports a score of 2-0.

All players should snap screenshots of the lobby score to be safe. In the case of lobby issues forcing multiple lobbies for a match, both players should report the final result.
