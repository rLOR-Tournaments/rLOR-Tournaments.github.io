# Tournament Sign-ups

The scheduled **Tournament Start** time for season tourneys is currently:
- `@EU Tournaments`: Sundays @ 7:00 PM BST/GMT [London time]
- `@AM Tournaments`: Sundays @ 6:00 PM EDT/EST [New York time]

There are three parts to joining each tournament:
- **Sign-ups**: `@Bannerman` posts sign-ups in `#event-news` **120 minutes** before Tournament Start and closes sign-ups **45 minutes** before Tournament Start. React to this post with the designated checkmark during this time to enter and sign-up, gaining an `@EU Tourney Participant` role or `@AM Tourney Participant` role and visibility of hidden tournament channels. Remove the reaction to leave.
- **Registration**: After signing-up, `@Bannerman` will send a DM to start an interactive registration. Follow its instructions to register in-game name and deck lists. Registration ends **30 minutes** before Tournament Start, so complete registration with the `register` command before then.
- **Check-in**: Check-in starts **60 minutes** before Tournament Start and ends **15 minutes** before Tournament Start. Post (anything) to the `#check-in` channel (hidden before entering) to check-in.

Season tourneys are capped at **64 players**. Any number of members can sign-up and register, but priority is given to players in registration completion order. Leaving the tourney removes a player from the queue, and re-entering places the player at end of the current queue. Any players beyond 64th in the queue are on standby, and move up in the queue whenever another player leaves the tourney.

At any time between the end of Check-in and the scheduled Tournament Start, the TO will:
1. Post public player info, including deck lists if the tourney is open-list. Players should double-check their info for accuracy.
2. Post the first-stage bracket with finalized Round 1 matches.
3. Announce the start of Round 1.
